# LinearResponseVariationalBayes.py

This is a library (very much still in development) intended to make
sensitivity analysis and optimization easier for
variational approximations, though it may be useful in more generality.

You should be able to install the package with the command
```pip install LinearResponseVariationalBayes```.

See ```Example.ipynb``` for a description and example usage.
